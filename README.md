# Multi-Label Chest X-Ray Classification using Deep Learning (PadChest Dataset)
üìç Project Overview
This repository contains my independent research project, focusing on multi-label classification of thoracic diseases from chest X-ray images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the PadChest dataset.

The project was originally conceptualized during my MSc Computer Science studies at Banaras Hindu University (BHU).
Currently, I am continuing and expanding the work post-degree as part of my ongoing learning and research in AI for Healthcare.

üìä Dataset: PadChest
Source: Hospital San Juan de Alicante, Spain

Size: 160,000+ chest X-ray images

Labels: 174 radiological findings, 19 differential diagnoses, 104 anatomical locations

Annotation: 27% manually labeled by physicians, rest via AI-based NLP pipeline (RNN with attention mechanism)

Access: Available for research use upon formal request (Follow PadChest Data Use Agreement)

üéØ Project Objectives
