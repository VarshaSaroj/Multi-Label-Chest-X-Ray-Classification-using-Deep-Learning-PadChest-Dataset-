# Multi-Label-Chest-X-Ray-Classification-using-Deep-Learning-PadChest-Dataset-
This is an independent research project, aimed at developing a multi-label classification system for thoracic disease detection from chest X-ray images using the PadChest dataset, collected from Hospital San Juan de Alicante, Spain.

Initially explored during my MSc Computer Science program at Banaras Hindu University (BHU), I am now continuing this project post-degree to deepen my understanding of medical image analysis and deep learning for healthcare applications.

Dataset Overview:

Over 160,000 high-resolution chest X-ray images from 67,000 patients

Annotated with 174 radiological findings, 19 differential diagnoses, and 104 anatomical locations

Hierarchically structured using UMLS terminology

Project Focus Areas:

Medical image preprocessing and normalization

Handling large-scale multi-label classification challenges

Designing and training CNN-based deep learning models

Tackling label imbalance issues

Model evaluation using metrics like AUC, Micro-F1 score, and Precision-Recall curves

Tools & Technologies:
Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
